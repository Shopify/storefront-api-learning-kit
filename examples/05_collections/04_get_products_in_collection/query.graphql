# This query returns data from a single collection, specified by the handle.

# The data returned in the product connection can be used to display a page of products.

# The `products` connection requires pagination in this query, since collections can contain a large number of products.
# This query includes the `sortKey` argument on the products connection, this returns products in the order specified by the sortKey

# Products can contain multiple images, so the `images` connection requires pagination.

# Since products can contain multiple variants, we've asked the products connection to return price ranges.

# In this example we only want to display 1 image per product, so we're only asking for first:1
