# You should see at the top of the frame that we're using the "base_url" and "api_version" to build out the address for the endpoint.
# You can also click "Header" at the top to see the use of the "storefront_access_token"
# Hovering over either of these should show you the value that will be substituted into the request.
# If you don’t see your values, ensure you have the right environment selected.

# Once you've confirmed these three fields are set in your environment, try running the shop query below.
# If the Storefront API access token has been configured correctly, you should get your shop’s info back.
