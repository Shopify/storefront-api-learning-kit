# ## About this repo

# This repo provides example queries demonstrating how to use Shopify's GraphQL [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api/getting-started). Downloading the package from the releases section, gives you access to a complete set of sample queries for use in the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) http client. The Insomnia desktop app comes with rich GraphQL features, including automatic schema fetching and autocomplete, which are extremely valuable in learning a new API.
